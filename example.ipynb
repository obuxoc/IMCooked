    "\n",
    "Welcome to the IMCity challenge. You'll be trading products on our custom-built **CMI Exchange** whose settlements are driven by real-world London data — tidal levels at Westminster, weather conditions, and flight activity at Heathrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 8 products: 2 Thames tidal products, 2 weather products, 2 flight products, an ETF combining them, and an options structure on the ETF. Your job is to build a profitable trading strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks you through everything you need: connecting to the exchange, understanding the products and their settlement formulas, fetching data, and building an automated trading bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**What's inside:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Connect** — register and authenticate\n",
    "2. **Products** — all 8 products with settlement formulas\n",
    "3. **Orderbook** — understand the market\n",
    "4. **Trading** — place GTC orders, cancel, IOC\n",
    "5. **Live events** — react to orderbook and trade updates\n",
    "6. **Strategy ideas** — approaches you might take\n",
    "7. **Data sources** — helpers for weather, tides, and flights\n",
    "8. **Price-time priority** — how the matching engine works\n",
    "9. **Simple quoter** — a working market-making bot\n",

    "## Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accounts & access:**\n",
    "- One account per team on the challenge exchange. Each team is permitted a single running bot on the challenge exchange.\n",
    "- The test exchange is open for experimentation — one account per person is permitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fair play:**\n",
    "- We're here to be smart and competitive, but also to have fun. Make sure everyone has an equal chance.\n",
    "- If we observe behaviour that would be illegal on a regulated market, we will ban the team. This includes:\n",
    "  - **Spoofing** — placing orders you intend to cancel before they fill, to mislead others\n",
    "  - **Layering** — stacking multiple orders on one side to create a false impression of supply/demand\n",
    "  - **Wash trading** — colluding with another team to generate fake volume/profits\n",
    "  - **Market manipulation** — any deliberate attempt to distort prices away from fair value to disadvantage others\n",
    "\n",
    "**API usage:**\n",
    "- Do not send more than **one request per second** (excluding the SSE market stream — that's free).\n",
    "- Excessive request loops will be treated as abuse and can result in a ban.\n",
    "- Do not attempt to exploit, overload, or break the exchange. Report bugs to the organisers.\n",
